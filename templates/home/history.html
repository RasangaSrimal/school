                    history. A new chapter dawned in the school&#39;s history was
                    that the concept of introducing an Old Boys Association which
                    was once limited to a few leading schools in cities and
                    suburbs. Later it gradually became a reality in 1999 with the
                    first annual prize giving ceremony taking place. This was in
                    fact, as a result of a long drawn up plan implemented by a few
                    astute old boys living in Colombo and Embilipitiya. The

                    held annually with the strenuous generous financial support
                    and guidance of all stakeholders involved would undoubtedly
                    create a profound positive effect on the school environment

                    year by year. Our school that was developing slowly though,
                    became a Navodya school and later it came under the concept of
                    secondary school status thus finally being recommended as a

                  promoted to 1AB type in 1986 marked a turning point in the
                  history of the school. When looking back on the history, Mr.
                  M.D. Nagarathna deserves a special mention as he was an asset
                  to our school. He received his basic education by being under
                  roof of his alma-mater North Kanumuldeniya. Later he became an
                  obstetrician (gynecologist){% endblocktranslate %}

                  {% blocktranslate %} On top of everything; this school has
                  been able to produce many a young student who excelled in
                  medicine, engineering and other streams as well in the school
                  history. A new chapter dawned in the school&#39;s history was
                  that the concept of introducing an Old Boys Association which
                  was once limited to a few leading schools in cities and
                  suburbs. Later it gradually became a reality in 1999 with the
                  first annual prize giving ceremony taking place. This was in
                  fact, as a result of a long drawn up plan implemented by a few
                  astute old boys living in Colombo and Embilipitiya. The
                  uninterrupted, continuous prize giving ceremony that has been
                  held annually with the strenuous generous financial support
                  and guidance of all stakeholders involved would undoubtedly
                  create a profound positive effect on the school environment
                  paving the way for the children to excel in different
                  disciplines since its inception.{% endblocktranslate %}

                  {% blocktranslate %} Further; holding the annual prize giving
                  and spending a whole hoard of money was by no means a waste,
                  as it is obvious by the fact that the percentage of G.C.E
                  (O/L) and G.C.E (A/L) exams results have been on the increase
                  year by year. Our school that was developing slowly though,
                  became a Navodya school and later it came under the concept of
                  secondary school status thus finally being recommended as a
                  National school on its way to success.{% endblocktranslate %}

                  the mind still evoking a feeling of appeal and victory looking

                  the teaching and listening process; it transpires that the

                  blends a perfect learner friendly atmosphere in this school to
                  be comprehensively competitive and victorious over fraternal
                  schools in the zone day by day. And also many children have
